                But there’s a lot that goes into being an astronaut that doesn’t always get media coverage. Did you know that astronauts on the International Space Station have to work out at least two hours a day, six days a week? If they didn’t, the microgravity environment would lead to a serious loss in bone and muscle, and any number of long term heart issues. Did you know that NASA has to specially design the exercise equipment to work in microgravity? You can only run a treadmill for so long without floating away, after all.
Luckily for you, your treadmill is safe and sound here on Earth, and ready to help you train like an astronaut on a mission to Mars.

                Humans are designed to live with gravity. Gravity is one of the only consistent things across all of human evolution, so as a species, we’re really good at living in Earth-like gravity. Microgravity on the other hand, not so much. When in orbit on the ISS, the astronauts experience so little gravity that for our intents and purposes, it doesn’t exist. This makes it much easier to move around, as you can just kinda fling yourself from room to room. As much fun as that may be, it can cause some serious health issues. 
                <br><br>
                Your heart is used to pumping against gravity all the time, and it’s gotten pretty good at it. You, standing on Earth, get good consistent blood flow from your head to your toes because your heart has spent all it’s life fighting gravity. Now, when you get into orbit, your heart is no longer fighting gravity. For a six-month ISS mission, that’s six months of your heart not needing to fight gravity, six months of your heart getting weak. As it turns out, working out is really good at keeping your heart strong and healthy. By forcing your heart to pump at higher rates just to keep up with your oxygen consumption, you can keep your heart from atrophying.
                <br><br>
                The rest of your muscles face the same problem. If they don’t get used, they don’t need to exist, and astronauts can end up losing 15% of their muscle mass from just six months in space. Working out the level astronauts on the ISS train is a very effective way to prevent this atrophy. The combination of running, biking, and lifting keeps all your major muscles engaged and working at a similar level to on Earth.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, your bones also face issues with atrophy in microgravity. Bones, however, tend to atrophy due to lack of impact more than anything else. Just walking around on Earth causes stress to your bones, which then heal stronger than they were before. If bones don’t have these constant stresses and opportunities to heal, astronauts can end up dealing with osteoporosis and other long-term bone issues. However, impact-based exercise, like running and certain lifts, can be used to combat this.

                    <li><strong>Resistive Exercise Device (RED) </strong> : 
                        <br><br>
                        The RED (and it’s newest model, the advanced RED or aRED) is an all-purpose lifting machine. The problem with most lifting equipment in space is that there is no gravity. It doesn’t matter if a dumbbell weighs 100 kilograms on Earth, because in orbit it will weigh next to nothing. And as cool as it would be to just be casually curling 100 kilos anytime, it doesn’t get you a workout. The solution? A machine that uses vacuums to simulate weight!
                        <br><br>
                        The aRED uses adjustable vacuum cylinders to allow astronauts to change how much “weight” they are “lifting”. The device can be set up in one of more than half a dozen configurations, depending on which exercise the astronauts are doing. aRED also tracks the astronauts progress. With a tablet hooked up to the machine, every lift an astronaut does is measured and recorded. This allows both the astronauts themselves to track and progress, and Mission Control can check in and make sure they’re actually lifting enough.
                        <br><br>
                        The astronauts use aRED daily, or else they risk permanently losing muscle mass. For your training plan, we won’t be doing that. aRED is a lifting device, yes, but more than that it’s meant to simulate what it’s like to exist in an environment with gravity. Given that you live in a gravitationally stable environment, you don’t need to lift as often as the astronauts do.
                        <br><br>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Treadmills</strong> :
                        <br><br>
                        Yes, there are in fact treadmills on the ISS! You may ask, but wouldn’t the astronauts just fly off if they try to run? And if it was a standard treadmill like what you see at the gym, the answer would be yes. However, much like the aRED, NASA has specially designed a treadmill to work in microgravity. In its present iteration, the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or COLBERT, looks and acts almost like any other treadmill, except for one big difference: COLBERT has a harness to keep you from flying away.
                        <br><br>
                        The harness in question goes around your waist and up over your shoulders, and keeps you strapped into the COLBERT so you can actually get a good run in. Additionally, the harness has adjustable resistance, based on your own body weight. When astronauts first arrive on the ISS, the harness gets set to roughly 60% of their body weight on Earth. As they spend more time on the station, the harness gets slowly upped to 100% of their body weight. Just like aRED, there is a tablet attached to COLBERT that tracks the data for each astronaut, both for their own personal review and for Mission Control to make sure they’re keeping their cardio up.
                        <br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cycle Ergometers</strong> :
                        <br><br>
                        Last but not least, bikes in space! Like the COLBERT and the aRED, the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization, or CEVIS, is a specially designed bike meant to work like a real bike, just without gravity. In the case of CEVIS, this entails bike pedals, the accompanying tablet, and a wall with a set of handles. Turns out, biking in microgravity is actually really similar to biking in Earth gravity: as long as you can stay on the seat, you’ll be golden. And that’s what CEVIS is designed to do
                        <br><br>
                        In general, CEVIS is the best cardio workout on the ISS. That is, it gets the astronauts heart rates into the steady-state zone more effectively than COLBERT, and much more effectively than aRED. This zone depends on the person, but can be anywhere from 130 beats per minute up to 170.

                On the ISS, they have their main three pieces of training equipment, all of which have an Earth-based counterpart. And while aRED, COLBERT, and CEVIS are very good at what they do, it can’t hurt to have a few more options for microgravity workouts. And that brings us to a very important question: What makes a machine good for working out in space?
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, it must be easy to use. Astronauts only have so much time in orbit, and they want to get as much done as possible. If a piece of equipment takes too long to set up, or isn’t particularly intuitive, it’s not worth it in space.</li>
                    <li>Second, it doesn’t need gravity to use, or as on the ISS, it can be altered so it doesn’t need gravity. This means a lot of steady-state equipment that involves sitting down, like bicycles and ergometers. Sure, you might need to be strapped in on the ISS, but that’s pretty easy to set up.</li>
                    <li>Third, it must be low maintenance. On the ISS, missions come and go every couple of months, and can bring almost anything with relatively short notice. On a mission to Mars, that’s just not possible. Anything you need, you need to bring with you from the start. Thus, a workout machine that doesn’t need much maintenance is going to be much easier to use than one that does.</li>
                    <li>Fourth, it must be equipment that does not cause injuries. At the core of it, no one anywhere wants to use a machine that might cause you to get hurt unnecessarily. But in space, that’s a whole lot more important. If an astronaut gets injured on a mission to Mars, that can become a serious problem for the entire mission. Therefore, equipment should be safe to use, and work best in a high repetitions/low resistance format.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                By these metrics, the equipment currently on the ISS is very good for exercising in microgravity. The aRED alone is rated for a minimum of 15 years of constant use. But, are there any other machines that would be good in microgravity? We believe there are, and these are even accessible here on Earth!
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, resistance bands. A good set of resistance bands can be used for any number of lifting-like exercises. They don’t rely on gravity to function, and given that a complete set will have at least five levels of resistance, they provide a lot of options for increasing your workload over time. Additionally, resistance bands are small and lightweight, and pretty easy to pack.</li>
                    <li>Second, an ergometer, or rowing machine. Ergs require the user to sit down while in use, and work out up to 85% of your major muscles groups in a single session.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, a high quality erg will last at least a decade with very little maintenance, and if properly cared for, might outlive your grandchildren. Thought ergs don’t provide the same impact as COLBERT, they are great for cardio work and can be easily altered to work in microgravity.</li>

                For a manned mission to Mars, the astronauts are going to need 900 days worth of exercise, all meticulously planned to maximize their strength and endurance in microgravity. For you to train like an astronaut, below is a six week training plan like what they would use in space. Use as you see fit!
